# 🎮 Video Game Sales Forecasting

This project explores global video game sales data to uncover trends by platform, genre, region, and user preferences. The analysis was designed to help a fictional retailer, *Ice*, plan a 2017 marketing campaign based on historical data from 2013–2016.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset includes:
- Game names, platforms, release years

## 🔍 Key Analysis Areas

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
- Trends in game releases and sales over time
- Top-performing platforms and genres

## 🧪 Key Tools & Libraries

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy)
- Hypothesis testing with `scipy.stats`
- Pivot tables and groupby for data reshaping
- Seaborn for clean and consistent visualizations
