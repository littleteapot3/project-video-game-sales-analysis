# 🎮 Video Game Sales Forecasting

This project explores global video game sales data to uncover trends by platform, genre, region, and user preferences. The analysis was designed to help a fictional retailer, *Ice*, plan a 2017 marketing campaign based on historical data from 2013–2016.

📍 **Bootcamp Project — Sprint 5: Exploratory Data Analysis**

---

## 📊 Project Objective

Help a global game retailer identify:
- Which platforms and genres to prioritize
- How regional preferences differ
- How user and critic reviews affect sales
- What patterns can be used to forecast 2017 success

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset includes:
- Game names, platforms, release years
- Regional and global sales (NA, EU, JP, Other)
- User and critic ratings
- ESRB ratings and genres

📦 Source: Provided by bootcamp for educational use

## 🔍 Key Analysis Areas

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
- Trends in game releases and sales over time
- Top-performing platforms and genres
- Platform lifecycle analysis (lifespan, emergence/fade patterns)
- Regional preferences across NA, EU, JP

### 2. **Hypothesis Testing**
- Are Xbox One and PC user ratings statistically different?
- Do Action and Sports genres receive significantly different user ratings?

### 3. **Forecasting Strategy for 2017**
- Platforms to invest in (e.g., PS4, XOne, 3DS)
- Genre focus areas (Action, Shooter, Sports)
- Region-specific strategies for Japan vs. NA/EU

---

## 🧪 Key Tools & Libraries

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy)
- Hypothesis testing with `scipy.stats`
- Pivot tables and groupby for data reshaping
- Seaborn for clean and consistent visualizations
